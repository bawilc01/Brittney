Movie database project for C# 2019 Session

Have a problem of buying multiple copies of a movie because we don't know we have it or we have different "special" versions of it.

Created a console app that will allow users to add or view the database of movies.

It will add new items to a list. The list items are converted to database items and stored in a sqlite database to be called MovieDatabase.

Each movies will have an id, Title, Type, and a Number of Copies field.
